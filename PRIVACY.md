# Privacy Policy for InstaControl

**Effective Date: January 13, 2026**

InstaControl ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection and usage for the InstaControl browser extension.

## 1. No Data Collection
InstaControl is designed with a "Local-First" philosophy. 
- **We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**
- We do not track your browsing history.
- We do not access, collect, or store your Instagram login credentials, profile data, or private messages.
- No data is ever sent to external servers or third parties.

## 2. Permissions and Their Usage
To provide its core functionality, the extension requires certain browser permissions. Here is why they are used:
- **`activeTab` & `https://www.instagram.com/*`**: Used solely to inject the custom video player interface and apply video transformations (rotation/flipping) on Instagram.com.
- **`tabs`**: Used to detect when you navigate between different Reels or Posts on Instagram to ensure the controls remain active.

## 3. Third-Party Services
InstaControl interacts with the Instagram website to enhance the video player. We are not affiliated with Meta or Instagram. 
The extension may load static assets (specifically **Google Fonts**) to provide a consistent visual interface in the popup menu. These are static requests for font files and do not involve tracking of user activity.

## 4. Storage of Preferences
The extension may use the browser's local storage to remember your preferred volume level and mute status. This data stays entirely on your local machine and is never synced or shared.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by the "Effective Date" at the top of this document.

## 6. Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can reach out via the extension's official GitHub repository or the Chrome Web Store support page.
